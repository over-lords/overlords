                Overlords is a cooperative card game that can be played with 1 to 6 Players. <br><br> The goal is to work alongside other heroes and defeat the villains, saving as many civilians as you can. <br><br> It is a fully automated game, so aside from you, and your friends', actions, the mechanics will handle themselves. All you have to do is pick which Hero(es) to play, and which cards to use.
                <br><br>
                &emsp;When creating Overlords, we had two key goals:
                <br>
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;1) To make a card game where every time you queue up, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you never know what’s going to happen.</span> The goal is to work with what you have, and still come out on top. To provide interesting scenarios that would make you think and wonder about the possibilities of your next game, and the one after that. To keep coming back because you had fun.
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;2) To make something you can sit down with yourself on the train or a plane and just play, or queue up with your friends for a fun board game night or a challenging quest to see who could come out on top of an impossible scenario.

                <br><br>
                &emsp;We wanted to make a game where it wasn't about beating each other, but about working together and doing so with characters you already enjoyed.

            <h2 style="color: black;">
                Single and Multiplayer games are offered. We support 1 through 6 players. Depending on the number of players, that determines how many heroes you personally can select to play with.
                <br><br>
                How You Win:
                <br>
                • Reduce the Overlord to 0 HP. There are no other win conditions, you beat the bad guy, or you lose.
                <br><br>
                How You Lose:
                <br>
                • All Heroes are reduced to 0 HP.

                <text-body style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">After setting up your game, let's talk about how it's run - starting with the Villain's actions.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;Once you load in, with the order of your heroes being randomly decided, the first thing to happen will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a card is drawn from the Villain Deck</span>.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;Cards drawn from the Villain Deck are placed in the upper slots along the board, traveling right to left along the six Cities <span style="text-decoration: underline;">until they reach the end of the board and escape</span>.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;You will draw another card at the start of each Hero's turn, so if not dealt with, the threats it unleashes could rapidly overwhelm you and your team.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;Henchmen and Villains (explained later) from the Villain Deck push those ahead of them, even those freshly emerging from the Villain Deck. This means that if not dealt with, they will start pushing themselves off the end of the board and escaping, which is very, very bad for you.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;If a Hero enters a City with a Henchman or Villain, they stop moving in order to fight. This is a great way to prevent their escape. However, this leaves you vulnerable to losing that Hero.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;If a Henchman or Villain escapes, then most commonly they will KO any Bystanders they had captured, and then they increase the Overlord's HP by whatever they had remaining. In rare circumstances, they can initiate a Takeover, but that is explained later.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Now, for the Heroes' turn.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;The Player controlling the turn Hero will declare which threat they wish to take on, either by sending them to a city, or having them initiate an assault against the Overlord. <br> &emsp;&emsp; Then, after doing so, they are given a choice of the top 3 cards from their deck, and they pick 1 to add to their hand. After choosing, their deck is shuffled.</span>

                            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Hero Deck:</span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;Every Hero consists of a primary Icon Card and 20 pre-determined Action Cards. All you have to do is pick your Hero or Heroes for a game and the rest is handled automatically.</span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;In singleplayer games, you can pick 1 to 6 Heroes to play with. Where as in multiplayer, the rules are a bit different. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; If you have 2 players, you have the choice to select between 1 and 3 Heroes each. With 3 players, you can each pick 1 or 2 Heroes a piece. And with 4+ players, you can only select a single Hero each. The creator of the room can select enough to fill up the space, so that is 3 at 4 players, 2 at 5, and 1, like everyone else, at 6.</span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Overlord and his Plan:</span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;When playing multiplayer, the following entries are decided automatically, but when playing singleplayer, you can set them up however you like.</span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overlord:</span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;Every evil plot needs a big bad, and for this game, that's the Overlord. There are 3 difficulties of Overlord, as denoted in the selector by a 1 (easy), 2 (medium), or 3 (hard). Each Overlord has HP, as well as their basic abilities and their Might of the Overlord ability, which is activated each time a Might of the Overlord is pulled from the Villain Deck.</span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tactics:</span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;The Tactic is the plan the Overlord has come up with. Most Tactics are split into two parts - 1. The passive change to the game's rules. 2. A Might of the Overlord effect.</span>
                            <br><br>
                            &emsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Villain Deck:</span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;Consisting of every part of an Overlord's plan, from the Bystanders they will kidnap, or their dramatic shows of might, the Villain Deck is meant to throw an endless tide of problems to stamp out preventing you from tackling the greater threat in the Overlord.</span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Villain Deck (60-140, Recommended 100)</span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Might of the Overlords (3-10, Recommended 8): This card activates an effect on both the Overlord, and within the Tactic. The Overlord effect is declared and resolves first, before the Tactic. Both effects can only be performed once per turn, and cannot cascade into each other. So if a Might effect draws from the Villain Deck, it cannot play another Might of the Overlord.</span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Bystanders (7-15, Recommended 10): Bystanders can be one of a few kinds, from Undercover Agents to Captured Sidekicks. They are taken by the rightmost Villain or Henchman and are kept, traveling with them across the board, until the baddie escapes or they are rescued. If their captor escapes, they are KO'd and their effect is lost. If they are rescued, which is done when you defeat their captor before they make it to the end of the board, you get them into your hand like any other card. But they stay there until used, as long as you want to hold them. Basic Bystanders have no effect, and do not enter your hand as there is no need. Some Tactics or Overlords may cause you to lose the game if too many Bystanders are lost, so try to save them when possible.</span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Scenarios (0-5, Recommended 2): Scenarios are incredibly varied Overlord overlays found within the Villain Deck. They overlap the Overlord until they are defeated. They have their own HP, and their own rule to play over top of their effects. They do not have Might of the Overlord effects. They are what happens when a bad guy has this dramatic plan to destroy the city, but then aliens invade, and then zombies rise up, and the whole thing gets thrown out to deal with that until they can resume the struggle.</span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Henchmen (20-40, Recommended 30): Little problems sprinkled in by an Overlord; Henchmen have low HP, moderate to low Damage, and always have a positive effect when you take them out, like a little prize package. They can clog the board, but also incentivize dealing with them as you may wind up ahead for doing so.</span>

                            <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Villains (30-70, Recommended 40): Those who are above Henchmen, but below Overlords, are the Villains. They're strong, tough, and varied. They require a multitude of strategies to beat, and often come with their own unique challenges. Some can even beat up a weakened Overlord and take over themselves.</span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;The Countdown of Doom: The bottom 6 'cards' of the Villain Deck are the Countdown of Doom, a series of cards that flattens cities, KO's Villains, and slams Heroes aside. It is the final coming, the doomsday clock, the end of the game. If the Countdown finishes, and reaches the end of the board, the game ends and you lose.</span>

                            <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;A completely separate deck that is only drawn from when cards or other effects call for it. The Ally effects are beneficial, and the Enemy effects are detrimental. It is completely random what you will pull unless an Enemy or Ally is guaranteed by the effect drawing from the deck. It is built automatically of equal parts Enemies and Allies unless specified otherwise by: An effect in the Tactic or on the Overlord, within the singleplayer game builder, or by selecting Nightmare difficulty in the multiplayer game creator.</span>

                            <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;Every evil plot needs a big bad, and for this game, that's the Overlord. There are 3 difficulties of Overlord, as denoted in the selector by a 1 (easy), 2 (medium), or 3 (hard). Each Overlord has HP, as well as their basic abilities and their Might of the Overlord ability, which is activated each time a Might of the Overlord is pulled from the Villain Deck.</span>

                            <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;Tactics are not cards, just plans that the Overlord uses. Tactics have difficulty levels 1 (easy), 2 (medium), or 3 (hard), just like Overlords. Most Tactics are split into two parts - 1. The passive change to the game's rules. 2. A Might of the Overlord effect. Some may not have one or the other, but most have both.</span>
