                <text-body style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">After setting up your game, let's talk about how it's run - starting with the Villain's actions.</span>

                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;When loading into the game, the order of your Heroes will be assigned to you. Then, the first thing to happen will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a card is drawn from the Villain Deck</span>.</span>
                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;Cards drawn from the Villain Deck are placed in the upper slots along the board, traveling right to left along the six Cities <span style="text-decoration: underline;">until they reach the end of the board and escape</span>.</span>
                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;You will draw another card at the start of each Heroes' turn, so if not dealt with, the threats it unleashes could rapidly overwhelm you and your team.</span>
                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;Henchmen and Villains (explained later) from the Villain Deck push those ahead of them, even those freshly emerging from the Villain Deck. This means that if not dealt with, they will start pushing themselves off the end of the board and escaping, which is very, very bad for you.</span>
                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;If a Hero enters a City with a Henchman or Villain, they do not stop moving in order to fight (unless one or both has an ability that makes them). So, there is no stalling. Beat them fast and hard or they will overwhelm you.</span>
                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;If a Henchman or Villain escapes, then most commonly they will KO any Bystanders they had captured, and then they increase the Overlord's HP by whatever they had remaining. In rare circumstances, they can initiate a Takeover, but that is explained later.</span>

                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Now, for the Heroes' turn.</span>

                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;The Player controlling the turn Hero will declare which threat they wish to take on, either by sending them to a City, or having them initiate an assault against the Overlord. Then, after doing so, they are given a choice of the top 3 cards from their deck, and they pick 1 to add to their hand. After choosing, their deck is shuffled. If you start your turn with your Hero already in a city, then they do not travel, and you skip to your draw selection.</span>
                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;Clicking on a card populates a viewing window on the left side of the screen, it also reveals a unique symbol over top of the card, this is the play button. Click that, and you will activate the card below it. This will do all that card says, giving you the chance to choose either or for what you want the card to do in the event of a card with 2+ effects.</span>
                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;Your cards with Damage attack a Villain's HP, you hit before them, so try to take them out before they get a shot at you!</span>
                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;If a Hero's Deck runs out on their turn and they would still have to draw more cards, the number of cards drawn this turn will be referenced. If you have drawn a total of 4 or less cards this turn, including your initial draw, the deck will be shuffled and you can draw again per your number of draws remaining. If you have drawn 5 or more, you cannot shuffle and draw, instead you must end your turn and the deck will be shuffled at the very end and returned for your next turn.</span>
                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;If, at the very end of a Hero's turn, you did not KO your foe and you chose, or were unable to leave, the City they were in, they will take Damage equal to their Damage. If their Damage is less than your Damage Threshold, you ignore it, otherwise it is subtracted from your HP.</span>
                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;After you take the Villain's Damage, you discard all the cards left in your hand (if any, not counting Bystanders), then it becomes the next turn.</span>
                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;At any point during your turn, your Hero can travel. They can move from any spot, to any other spot. Your initial placement at the start of your turn counts as Travel. So if you have 2 or higher, you can move them from their current position to any other on the board, including back to Headquarters to face the Overlord. If you just send them back to Headquarters with no fight against the Overlord, that's called Retreat, which is different, and does not count as Travel. If you leave a City with an active Villain, you will take their Damage automatically if you do not succeed on a roll against your Retreat Requirement. This is a standard d6 roll, where meeting or beating your number is all you have to do. Therefore a 2 is the best Retreat you can have, and a 6 is the worst. No Hero has a 1, but cards or effects may be able to reduce it to 1 temporarily. When you enter a new City, it acts as if you were just starting your turn, minus the excavate and draw. If you had 3 cards left in hand when beating a Henchman, and you have a Travel of 2, why not go 3 spaces down the board to take out another?</span>
                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;If you want to Travel to a currently occupied City, this is called Shoving. You move the Hero there out of the City and back to Headquarters, and when you do, you take the Villain's Damage instantly upon entering, the Shoved Hero takes no Damage, and if you don't beat the Villain, you will take it again at the end of your turn. Everything else functions identically. You can decide to shove as your initial travel at the start of your turn, or later on.</span>
                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;Retreating is when you leave a City to head back to Headquarters without defeating the Villain, and this can be done at any time. You must succeed a d6 roll against your Retreat Requirement, and if you fail you take that Villain's Damage, but you do still Retreat. You can, after you Retreat, and if you have the availability to, Travel again. Otherwise, this is likely the end of your turn.</span>

                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Combat - Rewards and Consequences:</span>

                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;If the cards you play reduce a Henchman or Villain to 0 HP, you will KO them. Doing so earns you their "Reward" effect, if any. This could be anything, but it is clearly displayed on their card upon their entering of the map. So, read ahead if you want to earn better rewards! When you KO your enemy, you automatically return to the Headquarters. You can be sent out again only if you have the available Travel to do so.</span>
                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;From the Headquarters, you can instead "Travel" to face the Overlord. Since the Overlord has no dedicated space (which was done so you all could fight him at once) you fight him directly from the Headquarters, but doing so still requires the use of Travel, but does not require the use of Retreat to leave him, that happens automatically and you always succeed. You cannot defeat the Overlord if there are any active Henchmen or Villains still on the map. You must have a clear board before beating the Overlord. Cities are allowed to be destroyed, but so long as 1 remains, and it's unoccupied, you can still win by knocking the Overlord to 0 HP. If you would win (reduce the Overlord to 0 HP) while there is still a Henchman or Villain on the board, the Overlord is instead reduced to 1 HP, and cannot be Damaged any further.</span>
                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;If a Hero gets KO'd, that's probably the end of them. Very few effects bring a Hero back. They are greyed out, and their turn is perpetually skipped unless they are brought back.</span>

                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you reach the Countdown of Doom, it may already be too late.</span>

                        <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;If the Villain Deck runs out of cards, the Countdown begins. You have 6 turns to win, or the Countdown of Doom eats the board and you lose. A Countdown card does not push Villains aside, it destroys the City, KO'ing anyone inside of it. If your Hero is in a City when the Countdown card lands on it, they take 10 Damage, and if they are still active, they are sent back to Headquarters. Countdown cards can only be affected by other Countdown cards, and only to push them across the board. They will move until nothing remains.</span>

                        <text-body style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">
                            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Hero Deck:</span>

                                <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;Every Hero consists of a primary Icon Card and 20 pre-determined Action Cards. All you have to do is pick your Hero or Heroes for a game and the rest is handled automatically.</span>
                                <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;In singleplayer games, you can pick 1 to 6 Heroes to play with. Where as in multiplayer, the rules are a bit different. If you have 2 players, you have the choice to select between 1 and 3 Heroes each. With 3 players, you can each pick 1 or 2 Heroes a piece. And with 4+ players, you can only select a single Hero each. The creator of the room can select enough to fill up the space, so that is 3 Heroes for the creator at 4 players, 2 at 5, and 1, like everyone else, at 6.</span>

                            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Overlord and his Plan:</span>

                                <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;When playing multiplayer, the following entries are decided automatically, but when playing singleplayer, you can set them up however you like.</span>

                            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overlord:</span>

                                <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;Every evil plot needs a big bad, and for this game, that's the Overlord. There are 3 difficulties of Overlord, as denoted in the selector by a 1 (easy), 2 (medium), or 3 (hard). Each Overlord has HP, as well as their basic abilities and their Might of the Overlord ability, which is activated each time a Might of the Overlord is pulled from the Villain Deck.</span>

                            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tactics:</span>

                                <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;The Tactic is the plan the Overlord has come up with. Most Tactics are split into two parts - 1. The passive change to the game's rules. 2. A Might of the Overlord effect.</span>

                            &emsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Villain Deck:</span>

                                <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;Consisting of every part of an Overlord's plan, from the Bystanders they will kidnap, or their dramatic shows of might, the Villain Deck is meant to throw an endless tide of problems to stamp out preventing you from tackling the greater threat in the Overlord.</span>
                                <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Villain Deck (60-140, Recommended 90)</span></span>
                                <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Might of the Overlords (3-10, Recommended 8): This card activates an effect on both the Overlord, and within the Tactic. The Overlord effect is declared and resolves first, before the Tactic. Both effects can only be performed once per turn, and cannot cascade into each other. So if a Might effect draws from the Villain Deck, it cannot play another Might of the Overlord.</span>
                                <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Bystanders (7-15, Recommended 10): Bystanders can be one of a few kinds, from Undercover Agents to Captured Sidekicks. They are taken by the rightmost Villain or Henchman and are kept, traveling with them across the board, until the baddie escapes or they are rescued. If their captor escapes, they are KO'd and their effect is lost. If they are rescued, which is done when you defeat their captor before they make it to the end of the board, you get them into your hand like any other card. But they stay there until used, as long as you want to hold them. Basic Bystanders have no effect, and do not enter your hand as there is no need. Some Tactics or Overlords may cause you to lose the game if too many Bystanders are lost, so try to save them when possible.</span>
                                <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Scenarios (0-5, Recommended 2): Scenarios are incredibly varied Overlord overlays found within the Villain Deck. They overlap the Overlord until they are defeated. They have their own HP, and their own rule to play over top of their effects. They do not have Might of the Overlord effects. They are what happens when a bad guy has this dramatic plan to destroy the City, but then aliens invade, and then zombies rise up, and the whole thing gets thrown out to deal with that until they can resume the struggle.</span>
                                <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Henchmen (20-40, Recommended 30): Little problems sprinkled in by an Overlord; Henchmen have low HP, moderate to low Damage, and always have a positive effect when you take them out, like a little prize package. They can clog the board, but also incentivize dealing with them as you may wind up ahead for doing so.</span>
                                <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Villains (30-70, Recommended 40): Those who are above Henchmen, but below Overlords, are the Villains. They're strong, tough, and varied. They require a multitude of strategies to beat, and often come with their own unique challenges. Some can even beat up a weakened Overlord and take over themselves.</span>
                                <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;The Countdown of Doom: The bottom 6 'cards' of the Villain Deck are the Countdown of Doom. It is a wave of destruction that flattens cities, KO's Villains, and slams Heroes aside. It is the final coming, the doomsday clock, the end of the game. If the Countdown finishes and reaches the end of the board, the game ends and you lose.</span>

                            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enemies and Allies:</span>

                                <span class="bottom-space">&emsp;&emsp;A completely separate deck that is only drawn from when cards or other effects call for it. The Ally effects are beneficial, and the Enemy effects are detrimental. It is completely random what you will pull unless an Enemy or Ally is guaranteed by the effect drawing from the deck. It is built of whatever ratio you desire unless an effect in the Tactic or on the Overlord, within the singleplayer game builder, or by selecting Knightmare difficulty in the multiplayer game creator, makes it skew one way or another.</span>

It contains the Hero's name, teams, HP, Damage Threshold, Retreat Requirement, Travel Count, and their Icon Ability (or abilities). Every Hero has at least one Icon Ability, one that can be used usually 1-3 times per game; it's useful and reliable, it will come up. Some Heroes have an ability that is passive, and simply applies in certain situations, these Heroes likely have a weaker limited ability to handicap them for also having a passive.</span>

Or just rob banks. <br><br> &emsp;&emsp; Most Tactics are split into two parts - 1. The passive change to the game's rules. 2. A Might of the Overlord effect. Some may not have one or the other, but most have both.</span>

                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hero Abilities and Features</span>

                    <span class="bottom-space">• Block: Prevent a Hero, specified by the effect, from taking Damage one time.</span>
                    <span class="bottom-space">• Curse: Reduce a Henchman or Villain's Damage by a set amount for a set time (permanent if not specified).</span>
                    <span class="bottom-space">• Damage Threshold: The number that Henchmen, Villains, and other effects must meet or beat to hurt your Heroes. If you're bulletproof, a crowbar won't do much. So higher DT means tougher Hero. But this may also come with tradeoffs later.</span>
                    <span class="bottom-space">• Freeze: The Henchman or Villain cannot move for a specified amount of time (permanent if not specified).</span>
                    <span class="bottom-space">• Gain vs Regain: Every card with HP has a starting HP, if a card says to regain, then you cannot exceed that starting HP, if it says gain, then it can. Most of the time HP is all they're referencing, but this applies to all Gain vs Regain distinctions.</span>
                    <span class="bottom-space">• Hit Points (HP): The amount of life your Hero has, how many hits they can take before they drop. Reduce any card to 0, and it's KO'd.</span>
                    <span class="bottom-space">• Knockback: Return an active Henchman or Villain to the top of the Villain Deck.</span>
                    <span class="bottom-space">• Scan: Reveal the top card(s) of a given deck for all to see.</span>
                    <span class="bottom-space">• Sidekick: A card to be added to your Hero Deck when an effect says so. When drawn, the Sidekick vanishes and you draw 2 more cards from the top of your deck.</span>
                    <span class="bottom-space">• Withdraw: Retreat without taking Damage, no Retreat Roll is made.</span>

                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Villain Abilities and Features</span>

                    <span class="bottom-space">• Bringing Back Heroes as Villains: When a Hero is brought back as a Villain, that turn their entrance becomes the Villain Deck draw. Heroes change and warp as they become Villains, bringing out the worst they have to offer against you.</span>
                    <span class="bottom-space">• Charge: When drawn from the Villain Deck, after being placed in the rightmost City, this Villain then "Charges" an additional number of spaces as indicated on their card, pushing all those ahead of them.</span>
                    <span class="bottom-space">• Clash: When engaged with this Henchman or Villain, you do not continue to move across the board.</span>
                    <span class="bottom-space">• Eject: When damaged by this Henchman or Villain, your Hero is sent back to Headquarters.</span>
                    <span class="bottom-space">• Half-Damage: A Hero, when forced to only deal half damage, rounds up their damage to the nearest whole number, on a per-card basis. With a minimum damage of 1. So 3 damage rounds to 2, 5 to 3, and so on.</span>
                    <span class="bottom-space">• Takeover: If a Villain has this ability, and they reach the end of the board, supposing their Takeover ability number meets or exceeds the difficulty number on the Overlord, and they have the same (or more) HP than the current Overlord, they take over. They add the old Overlord’s remaining HP to whatever they still possess as well as replacing the Overlord’s Might of the Overlord ability with their own, and everything else operates the same, keeping any old additional loss conditions or dampening effects that the old Overlord may have set out at the start of the game.</span>
                    <span class="bottom-space">• Teleport: A Villain with the Teleport ability is randomly placed according to the roll of a d6 when they are drawn. With the rightmost City being 1, and leftmost City being 6. They then move as normal. If they land on a non-gliding Villain’s space, or the space of a city that has been destroyed, they must reroll the die until they roll a City on which they can land.</span>

                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Random Terms</span>
                    <span class="bottom-space">• Coastal City: The leftmost and rightmost cities. The coastal cities change to remain the leftmost and rightmost cities if the leftmost or rightmost cities are destroyed.</span>
                    <span class="bottom-space">• KO'ing: Anything can be KO'd. This is when its HP is reduced to 0. When KO'd, Henchmen and Villains go to a "Graveyard" of sorts to be viewed and potentially brought back by some effects. Permanently KO'd, an effect some cards have, stops this, and those cards are still visible, but are marked differently within the Graveyard. Bystanders, when KO'd are gone for good, and most of the time Heroes are too.</span>
